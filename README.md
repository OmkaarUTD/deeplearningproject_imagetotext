Image to Text Converter
This project implements an image-to-text conversion system using deep learning techniques. It utilizes a pre-trained vision encoder-decoder model to generate textual descriptions of input images.
Features
Convert images to textual descriptions
Utilizes the Salesforce BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model
Supports various image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
Easy-to-use interface for image upload and text generation
Requirements
Python 3.7+
PyTorch
Transformers
Pillow
Gradio
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-to-text-converter.git
cd image-to-text-converter

Install the required dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook:
bash
jupyter notebook Imgtotxt_DL.ipynb

Execute the cells in the notebook to set up the environment and launch the Gradio interface.
Upload an image using the Gradio interface.
The model will process the image and generate a textual description.
Model Details
This project uses the Salesforce BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model, specifically the Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base variant. BLIP is a vision-language pre-training framework that excels in various vision-language tasks, including image captioning1
